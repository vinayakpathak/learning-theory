# Multiclass Marginal Uniformization Open

## Verdict

`open`, with evidence `unknown`.

This note is the multiclass counterpart of the binary argument family. When it records a separation, the witness is usually obtained by embedding the binary witness into a finite multiclass label space. When it records a true implication, the proof uses only zero-one correctness and the majority-accuracy weak convention adopted by this multiclass atlas.

## Scope

The multiclass atlas is finite-label and separate from the binary atlas. The embedding observations here are used only to transfer lower-bound examples into the multiclass type; they do not create implication edges between binary and multiclass nodes.
