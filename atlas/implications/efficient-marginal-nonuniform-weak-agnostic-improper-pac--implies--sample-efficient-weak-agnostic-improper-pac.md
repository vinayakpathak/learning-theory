# Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Weak Agnostic Improper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Sample-Efficient Weak Agnostic Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`, by the binary sample-complexity equivalence and the marginal-nonuniform trichotomy.

## Theorem Statement

Let $\mathcal C$ be a binary concept class over an instance space $\mathcal X$, with representation-size parameter $s$; all errors are zero-one errors.

The **source guarantee** is: there is a single learner $A$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,Y)\sim\mathcal D$ from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathcal X\times\{0,1\}$, with instance marginal $P=\mathcal D_X$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every joint distribution $\mathcal D$, the guarantee is $\Pr[h(X)\ne Y]\le \inf_{c\in\mathcal C}\Pr[c(X)\ne Y]+1/2-\gamma_P(s)$. For every marginal $P$ there is a polynomial $p_P$ and an inverse-polynomial weak gap $\gamma_P(s)>0$ such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p_P(s,\log(1/\delta))$; the same learner works for all marginals, and $p_P$ and $\gamma_P$ may depend on $P$ but not on the conditional label distribution or $\delta$.

The **target guarantee** is: there is a single learner $B$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,Y)\sim\mathcal D$ from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathcal X\times\{0,1\}$, with instance marginal $P=\mathcal D_X$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every joint distribution $\mathcal D$, the guarantee is $\Pr[h(X)\ne Y]\le \inf_{c\in\mathcal C}\Pr[c(X)\ne Y]+1/2-\gamma(s)$. There is one polynomial $p$ and an inverse-polynomial weak gap $\gamma(s)>0$, independent of $P$ and $\mathcal D$, such that the worst-case sample size is bounded by $p(s,\log(1/\delta))$. No polynomial running-time bound is required.

The theorem asserts that every class satisfying the source guarantee also satisfies the target guarantee.

## Proof Sketch

**Goal.** Show that the source guarantee is enough for [[sample-efficient-weak-agnostic-improper-pac|Sample-Efficient Weak Agnostic Improper PAC Learning]] once polynomial running time is not required.

**Why the source gives sample control.** The source is a polynomial-rate marginal-nonuniform sample guarantee after ignoring any runtime requirement. In the sample-only binary setting, the usual VC/ERM equivalences convert among realizable, agnostic, weak, strong, proper, and improper variants.

**Why marginal nonuniformity uniformizes here.** Hanneke, Moran, and Thiessen's marginal-nonuniform trichotomy says that binary classes with finite VC dimension have linear marginal-nonuniform rates, while classes with infinite VC dimension require arbitrarily slow marginal-nonuniform rates. Therefore a polynomial marginal-nonuniform sample guarantee forces finite VC dimension.

**Why the target follows.** Standard VC theory gives distribution-free polynomial sample complexity for binary PAC learning when VC dimension is finite. Since runtime is unrestricted, exhaustive empirical risk minimization can be used to obtain the requested proper or improper target variant.

**Conclusion.** The implication is true as a sample-complexity statement. It should not be read as giving a polynomial-time learner.
