# Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Agnostic Improper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Sample-Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Weak Agnostic Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`, trivially.

The same learner witnesses the target notion, because the target only relaxes requirements already imposed by the source.
