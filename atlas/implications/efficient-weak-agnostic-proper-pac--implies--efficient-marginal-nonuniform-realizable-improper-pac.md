# Efficient Weak Agnostic Proper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Realizable Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`.

Weak agnostic proper learning specializes to weak realizable learning, and Schapire boosting gives the improper strong realizable target.

## Theorem Statement

Let $\mathcal C$ be a binary concept class over an instance space $\mathcal X$, with representation-size parameter $s$; all errors are zero-one errors.

The **source guarantee** is: there is a single learner $A$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,Y)\sim\mathcal D$ from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathcal X\times\{0,1\}$, with instance marginal $P=\mathcal D_X$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, outputs a hypothesis $h\in\mathcal C$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every joint distribution $\mathcal D$, the guarantee is $\Pr[h(X)\ne Y]\le \inf_{c\in\mathcal C}\Pr[c(X)\ne Y]+1/2-\gamma(s)$. There is one polynomial $p$ and an inverse-polynomial weak gap $\gamma(s)>0$, independent of $P$ and $\mathcal D$, such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p(s,\log(1/\delta))$.

The **target guarantee** is: there is a single learner $B$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le\varepsilon$. For every marginal $P$ there is a polynomial $p_P$ such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p_P(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$; the same learner works for all marginals, and $p_P$ may depend on $P$ but not on the target concept, $\varepsilon$, or $\delta$.

The theorem asserts that every class satisfying the source guarantee also satisfies the target guarantee.

## Proof Sketch

**Goal.** Build a strong realizable improper learner with marginal-dependent polynomial bounds.

**Reduction.** Restrict the source learner to realizable distributions. Since the benchmark error is zero, the additive weak agnostic guarantee gives error below $1/2$.

**Boosting step.** Apply Schapire's weak-to-strong boosting theorem. The final majority vote need not lie in $\mathcal C$, which is allowed by the target.

**Conclusion.** The result is a distribution-free strong realizable improper learner, hence also a marginal-nonuniform one.
