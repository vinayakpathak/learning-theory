# Efficient Realizable Improper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Realizable Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`.

The target is the same realizable improper guarantee with the distribution-free polynomial bound relaxed to a marginal-dependent one.

## Theorem Statement

Let $\mathcal C$ be a binary concept class over an instance space $\mathcal X$, with representation-size parameter $s$; all errors are zero-one errors.

The **source guarantee** is: there is a single learner $A$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le\varepsilon$. There is one polynomial $p$, independent of $P$ and $c$, such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$.

The **target guarantee** is: there is a single learner $B$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le\varepsilon$. For every marginal $P$ there is a polynomial $p_P$ such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p_P(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$; the same learner works for all marginals, and $p_P$ may depend on $P$ but not on the target concept, $\varepsilon$, or $\delta$.

The theorem asserts that every class satisfying the source guarantee also satisfies the target guarantee.

## Proof

**Goal.** Convert a distribution-free realizable improper learner into the marginal-nonuniform version.

**Construction.** Use the same learner. It already outputs an allowed improper hypothesis with error at most $\varepsilon$ on every realizable distribution.

**Why the construction works.** A distribution-free polynomial bound is a special case of a marginal-dependent polynomial bound: for every marginal $P$, set $p_P$ equal to the source polynomial.

**Conclusion.** The implication is immediate from weakening the uniformity requirement.
