# Efficient Agnostic Improper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Efficient Weak Realizable Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`.

This follows by weakening one or more requirements: agnostic to realizable, proper to improper, or strong to weak.

## Theorem Statement

Let $\mathcal C$ be a binary concept class over an instance space $\mathcal X$, with representation-size parameter $s$; all errors are zero-one errors.

The **source guarantee** is: there is a single learner $A$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,Y)\sim\mathcal D$ from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathcal X\times\{0,1\}$, with instance marginal $P=\mathcal D_X$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every joint distribution $\mathcal D$, the guarantee is $\Pr[h(X)\ne Y]\le \inf_{c\in\mathcal C}\Pr[c(X)\ne Y]+\varepsilon$. There is one polynomial $p$, independent of $P$ and $\mathcal D$, such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$.

The **target guarantee** is: there is a single learner $B$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le 1/2-\gamma(s)$. There is one polynomial $p$ and an inverse-polynomial weak gap $\gamma(s)>0$, independent of $P$ and $c$, such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p(s,\log(1/\delta))$.

The theorem asserts that every class satisfying the source guarantee also satisfies the target guarantee.

## Proof

The target notion only relaxes requirements already met by the source learner. On realizable distributions the agnostic optimum is zero, proper hypotheses are allowed in the improper model, and a strong learner can be run with a fixed weak accuracy parameter. The same efficient learner therefore witnesses the target node.
