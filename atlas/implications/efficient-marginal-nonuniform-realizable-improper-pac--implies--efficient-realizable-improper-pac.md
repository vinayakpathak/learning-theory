# Efficient Marginal-Nonuniform Realizable Improper PAC Learning $\Rightarrow$ Efficient Realizable Improper PAC Learning

## Verdict

`true`, by full-support marginal uniformization.

## Theorem Statement

Let $\mathcal C$ be a binary concept class over an instance space $\mathcal X$, with representation-size parameter $s$; all errors are zero-one errors.

The **source guarantee** is: there is a single learner $A$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le\varepsilon$. For every marginal $P$ there is a polynomial $p_P$ such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p_P(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$; the same learner works for all marginals, and $p_P$ may depend on $P$ but not on the target concept, $\varepsilon$, or $\delta$.

The **target guarantee** is: there is a single learner $B$ that, given i.i.d. examples $(X,c(X))$ with $X\sim P$ and $c\in\mathcal C$, confidence parameter $\delta\in(0,1)$, accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, outputs an arbitrary binary hypothesis $h$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. For every marginal $P$ and target $c\in\mathcal C$, the guarantee is $\Pr_{X\sim P}[h(X)\ne c(X)]\le\varepsilon$. There is one polynomial $p$, independent of $P$ and $c$, such that the worst-case sample size and running time are bounded by $p(s,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$.

The theorem asserts that every class satisfying the source guarantee also satisfies the target guarantee.

## Proof Status

Let $A$ be the single learner promised by the marginal-nonuniform source. Choose a reference marginal $P^\star$ with full support on every finitely encoded instance in each representation-size slice. The source gives a polynomial $p_{P^\star}$ bounding $A$'s sample use and running time under this marginal.

Because $P^\star$ has full support, every finite labeled transcript that can occur under any marginal has positive probability under $P^\star$ for a suitable target concept. Under the atlas worst-case/pathwise resource convention, $A$ cannot exceed $p_{P^\star}$ on any such transcript. Therefore $p_{P^\star}$ is one distribution-free resource bound for $A$.

Accuracy is not transferred from $P^\star$. For any actual marginal $P$ and target concept $c\in\mathcal C$, apply the source guarantee directly to $P$. The same learner $A$, with the uniform resource bound above, is an efficient distribution-free realizable improper learner.
